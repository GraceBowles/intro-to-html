            <p>  My name is Grace Bowles, I am 21 from Ottawa Ontario. 
                 I am in my first year of Graphic Design. I previously went to Carleton University for Environmental Studies but decided it wasn't for me in my second year. I then took the feeder program for Graphic Design, Design Foundations which got me into Graphic Design! 
                 The photo above is a picture of my dog Finnley....but we call him finny!
                 Dispite Finnley being by dog he tends to show favouritisem towards my parents.

             Hobbies that I do in my free time include, art, walking my dog, snowboarding, skating, swimming and spending time with my family. 
             Art has played a major role in my life as I paint, draw, sketch in my free time since I was little. I tend to use it as an escape from reality, a place where I can let my day to day anxieties rest.
             I tend to take my dog on atleast one walk a day, and on some days I take to the dog park so he can run around and get his energy out.
